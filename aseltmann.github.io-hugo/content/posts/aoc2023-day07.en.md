This year I try to record my attempt at solving the **Advent of Code 2023**
riddles. This is Day 7 - see <https:adventofcode.com/2023/day/7>


## Part 1 {#part-1}

<details>
<summary>Lets first read the task:</summary>
<div class="details">

> In Camel Cards, you get a list of **hands**, and your goal is to order them based
> on the **strength** of each hand. A hand consists of **five cards** labeled one of
> `A`, `K`, `Q`, `J`, `T`, `9`, `8`, `7`, `6`, `5`, `4`, `3`, or `2`. The relative
> strength of each card follows this order, where `A` is the highest and `2` is
> the lowest.
>
> Every hand is exactly one type. From strongest to weakest, they are:
>
> -   **Five of a kind**, where all five cards have the same label: `AAAAA`
> -   **Four of a kind**, where four cards have the same label and one card has a
>     different label: `AA8AA`
> -   **Full house**, where three cards have the same label, and the remaining two
>     cards share a different label: `23332`
> -   **Three of a kind**, where three cards have the same label, and the remaining
>     two cards are each different from any other card in the hand: `TTT98`
> -   **Two pair**, where two cards share one label, two other cards share a second
>     label, and the remaining card has a third label: `23432`
> -   **One pair**, where two cards share one label, and the other three cards have a
>     different label from the pair and each other: `A23A4`
> -   **High card**, where all cards' labels are distinct: `23456`
>
> Hands are primarily ordered based on type; for example, every **full house** is
> stronger than any **three of a kind**.
>
> If two hands have the same type, a second ordering rule takes effect. Start by
> comparing the **first card in each hand**. If these cards are different, the hand
> with the stronger first card is considered stronger. If the first card in each
> hand have the **same label**, however, then move on to considering the **second card
> in each hand**. If they differ, the hand with the higher second card wins;
> otherwise, continue with the third card in each hand, then the fourth, then the
> fifth.
>
> So, `33332` and `2AAAA` are both **four of a kind** hands, but `33332` is stronger
> because its first card is stronger. Similarly, `77888` and `77788` are both a
> **full house**, but `77888` is stronger because its third card is stronger (and
> both hands have the same first and second card).
>
> To play Camel Cards, you are given a list of hands and their corresponding **bid**
> (your puzzle input). For example:

```text
32T3K 765
T55J5 684
KK677 28
KTJJT 220
QQQJA 483
```

> This example shows five hands; each hand is followed by its **bid** amount. Each
> hand wins an amount equal to its bid multiplied by its **rank**, where the weakest
> hand gets rank 1, the second-weakest hand gets rank 2, and so on up to the
> strongest hand. Because there are five hands in this example, the strongest hand
> will have rank 5 and its bid will be multiplied by 5.
>
> So, the first step is to put the hands in order of strength:
>
> -   `32T3K` is the only **one pair** and the other hands are all a stronger type, so
>     it gets rank **1**.
> -   `KK677` and `KTJJT` are both **two pair**. Their first cards both have the same
>     label, but the second card of `KK677` is stronger (`K` vs `T`), so `KTJJT`
>     gets rank **2** and `KK677` gets rank **3**.
> -   `T55J5` and `QQQJA` are both **three of a kind**. `QQQJA` has a stronger first
>     card, so it gets rank **5** and `T55J5` gets rank **4**.
>
> Now, you can determine the total winnings of this set of hands by adding up the
> result of multiplying each hand's bid with its rank (`765` \* 1 + `220` \* 2 +
> `28` \* 3 + `684` \* 4 + `483` \* 5). So the **total winnings** in this example are
> **`6440`**.
>
> Find the rank of every hand in your set. What are the total winnings?

My input file: [2023-12-07-1-aoc.txt](https://github.com/aseltmann/aseltmann.github.io-org-src/blob/main/data/2023-12-07-1-aoc.txt)

As always - let's read in the data.

```python
import pandas as pd

camel = pd.read_table('data/2023-12-07-1-aoc.txt', delim_whitespace=True,
                      header=None, names=['cards', 'bid'],
                      dtype={'cards': 'string', 'bid': 'Int64'})

1000 rows × 2 columns

For sorting, we need to compute a `type` column. The 7 types can be deduced
based on how many different cards are there (through `set()`) and the number of
cards.

Also, for the next step we prepare one column per card string in the `cards`.

```python
def get_type(cards):
    cardset = set(cards)
    cardlen = len(cardset)
    cardlist = list(cards)
    cardnum = [cardlist.count(i) for i in cardset]
    if cardlen == 1:
        ctype = 1
    elif cardlen in (4, 5):
        ctype = cardlen + 2
    elif cardlen == 2:
        ctype = 2 if set(cardnum) == {1, 4} else 3
    else:
        ctype = 4 if 3 in cardnum else 5
    return ctype

camel['type'] = camel.loc[:, 'cards'].apply(lambda x: get_type(x))
for i in range(5):
    camel[f'c{i}'] = camel.loc[:, 'cards'].apply(lambda x: list(x)[i])
camel
```

|     | cards | bid | type | c0  | c1  | c2  | c3  | c4  |
|-----|-------|-----|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 0   | A833A | 309 | 5    | A   | 8   | 3   | 3   | A   |
| 1   | Q33J3 | 205 | 4    | Q   | 3   | 3   | J   | 3   |
| 2   | 55KK5 | 590 | 3    | 5   | 5   | K   | K   | 5   |

| 999 | 6J66J | 114 | 3    | 6   | J   | 6   | 6   | J   |

1000 rows × 8 columns

For sorting, `pandas` contributes the `sort_values` method, which supports
sorting by multiple columns (here, we first sort according to `type`, then `c0`,
`c1`, ...). For easier sorting by numerical values, we convert the values using
the `card_dict` dictionary, which implements the given sorting order.

```python
card_dict = {c: i for i, c in enumerate([7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, '2', '3',
                                         '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9',
                                         'T', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'])}

camel = camel.sort_values(by=['type', 'c0', 'c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4'],
                          ignore_index=True,
                          key=lambda x: x.map(card_dict))
camel.index += 1
camel
```

|      | cards | bid | type | c0  | c1  | c2  | c3  | c4  |
|------|-------|-----|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1    | 237AQ | 157 | 7    | 2   | 3   | 7   | A   | Q   |
| 2    | 23K47 | 759 | 7    | 2   | 3   | K   | 4   | 7   |
| 3    | 249K8 | 612 | 7    | 2   | 4   | 9   | K   | 8   |
| 4    | 264A7 | 341 | 7    | 2   | 6   | 4   | A   | 7   |
| 5    | 26578 | 10  | 7    | 2   | 6   | 5   | 7   | 8   |
| ...  | ...   | ... | ...  | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 996  | AA5AA | 565 | 2    | A   | A   | 5   | A   | A   |
| 997  | AAATA | 704 | 2    | A   | A   | A   | T   | A   |
| 998  | AAAA3 | 145 | 2    | A   | A   | A   | A   | 3   |
| 999  | AAAAJ | 594 | 2    | A   | A   | A   | A   | J   |
| 1000 | JJJJJ | 219 | 1    | J   | J   | J   | J   | J   |

1000 rows × 8 columns

Lastly, we multiply the bid with the index and sum the result.

```python
camel.loc[:, 'bid'].mul(camel.index).sum()
```

</details>

What changes? We have to update our `get_type()` function and our `card_dict`
dictionary, otherwise the method stays the same!

Let's first write `get_type_joker()`: if no joker is in the cards, we can just
refer to `get_type()`. If we have 1, 2 or 5 different card faces, the answer is
trivial. We only have to use the number of jokers and the maximum number of
other faces if we have 3 or 4 different faces.

Note: if a `J` is present, there can never be **high card** (`type = 7`), because
we always can get **one pair**. Also we can never get **two pair** (`type = 5`),
because we can always construct **three of a kind** or **full house**.

```python
def get_type_joker(cards):
    cardset = set(cards)
    cardlen = len(cardset)
    cardlist = list(cards)
    cardnum = [cardlist.count(i) for i in cardset]
    if not 'J' in cardset:
        ctype = get_type(cards)
    else:
        idxj = list(cardset).index('J')
        numj = cardnum[idxj]
        cardnum.pop(idxj)
        if cardlen in [1, 2]:
            ctype = 1
        elif cardlen == 5:
            ctype = 6
        else:
            if (numj in [1, 2]) and (cardlen == 4):
                ctype = 4
            else:
                ctype = 6 - max(cardnum) - numj
    return ctype

camel['type'] = camel.loc[:, 'cards'].apply(lambda x: get_type_joker(x))

camel
```

|      | cards | bid | type | c0  | c1  | c2  | c3  | c4  |
|------|-------|-----|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1    | 237AQ | 157 | 7    | 2   | 3   | 7   | A   | Q   |
| 2    | 23K47 | 759 | 7    | 2   | 3   | K   | 4   | 7   |

| 1000 | JJJJJ | 219 | 1    | J   | J   | J   | J   | J   |

1000 rows × 8 columns

Now, we just move `J` in our new `card_dict_joker` to where it belongs, the rest
of the solution is the same.

```python
card_dict_joker = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(
    [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 'J', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9',
     'T', 'Q', 'K', 'A'])}

camel = camel.sort_values(by=['type', 'c0', 'c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4'],
                          ignore_index=True,
                          key=lambda x: x.map(card_dict_joker))
camel.index += 1
display(camel)
print('Our new solution: ', camel.loc[:, 'bid'].mul(camel.index).sum())
```
