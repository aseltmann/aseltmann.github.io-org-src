I try to solve this year's **Advent of Code 2024** riddles in R. This is Day 2 - see <https:adventofcode.com/2024/day/2>


## Part 1: Safe reports {#part-1-safe-reports}

<details>
<summary>Lets first read the task:</summary>
<div class="details">

> The unusual data (your puzzle input) consists of many **reports**,
> one report per line. Each report is a list of numbers called **levels** that are
> separated by spaces. For example:

```text
7 6 4 2 1
1 2 7 8 9
9 7 6 2 1
1 3 2 4 5
8 6 4 4 1
1 3 6 7 9
```

> This example data contains six reports each containing five levels.
>
> The engineers are trying to figure out which reports are **safe**. The Red-Nosed
> reactor safety systems can only tolerate levels that are either gradually
> increasing or gradually decreasing. So, a report only counts as safe if both of
> the following are true:
>
> -   The levels are either **all increasing** or **all decreasing**.
> -   Any two adjacent levels differ by **at least one** and **at most three**.
>
> In the example above, the reports can be found safe or unsafe by checking those
> rules:
>
> -   `7 6 4 2 1`: **Safe** because the levels are all decreasing by 1 or 2.
> -   `1 2 7 8 9`: **Unsafe** because `2 7` is an increase of 5.
> -   `9 7 6 2 1`: **Unsafe** because `6 2` is a decrease of 4.
> -   `1 3 2 4 5`: **Unsafe** because `1 3` is increasing but `3 2` is decreasing.
> -   `8 6 4 4 1`: **Unsafe** because `4 4` is neither an increase or a decrease.
> -   `1 3 6 7 9`: **Safe** because the levels are all increasing by 1, 2, or 3.
>
> So, in this example, **`2`** reports are **safe**.
>
> Analyze the unusual data from the engineers. **How many reports are safe?**

My input file: [2024-12-02-1-aoc.txt](https://github.com/aseltmann/aseltmann.github.io-org-src/blob/main/data/2024-12-02-1-aoc.txt)

First, let's load the data and take a look:

```jupyter-R
data <- data.table::fread("2024-12-02-1-aoc.txt", header = FALSE, fill = TRUE)
head(data)
```

| V1          | V2          | V3          | V4          | V5          | V6          | V7          | V8          |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| &lt;int&gt; | &lt;int&gt; | &lt;int&gt; | &lt;int&gt; | &lt;int&gt; | &lt;int&gt; | &lt;int&gt; | &lt;int&gt; |
| 74          | 76          | 78          | 79          | 76          | NA          | NA          | NA          |
| 38          | 40          | 43          | 44          | 44          | NA          | NA          | NA          |
| 1           | 2           | 4           | 6           | 8           | 9           | 13          | NA          |
| 65          | 68          | 70          | 72          | 75          | 76          | 81          | NA          |
| 89          | 91          | 92          | 95          | 93          | 94          | NA          | NA          |
| 15          | 17          | 16          | 18          | 19          | 17          | NA          | NA          |

My core idea here was to compute the differences between each element in a row -
luckily, `R` provides an inbuilt `diff()` function that provides exactly what I
need. Then, we check if all differences are either 1, 2, 3 or -1, -2, -3. Note
that each row has a different number of elements, so we have to omit NA values
via `na.omit` when applying the check.

```jupyter-R
isalltrue <- function(rep) {
    return(all(diff(rep) %in% c(1, 2, 3)) |
           all(diff(rep) %in% c(-1, -2, -3)))
}

isreport <- function(row) {
    return(isalltrue(na.omit(row)))
}
valid.reports <- apply(data, 1, isreport)
table(valid.reports)
```

```text
valid.reports
FALSE  TRUE
  743   257
```

So, this task is a good example on how easy it is to get lost in a overly
complicated approach. My first approach was basically to somehow check if the
general trend was descending or ascending and based on that to remove opposite
differences. This was too complicated and in the end I found 4 less safe reports
than were needed... (Also note the beautiful print debuggin...)

<details>
<div class="details">

```jupyter-R

isalltrue <- function(reptrue1, reptrue2) {
    return((all(reptrue1) == TRUE) | (all(reptrue2) == TRUE))
}

iscorrtrue <- function(rep, reptrue) {
    rep <- rep[-which.min(reptrue)]
    repdiff <- diff(rep)
    reptrue1 <- !(repdiff < 1 | repdiff > 3)
    reptrue2 <- !(repdiff < -3 | repdiff > -1)
    out <- isalltrue(reptrue1, reptrue2)
    print(rep)
    print(out)
    return(out)
}

isreport2 <- function(row) {
    print("")
    rep <- na.omit(as.numeric(row))
    print(c(rep))
    repdiff <- c(1, diff(rep))
    reptrue1 <- !(repdiff < 1 | repdiff > 3)
    repdiff <- c(-1, diff(rep))
    reptrue2 <- !(repdiff < -3 | repdiff > -1)
    if (isalltrue(reptrue1, reptrue2) == TRUE) {
        out <- isalltrue(reptrue1, reptrue2)
        print("----- 1 -----")
        print(out)
    } else if (sum(diff(rep) > 0) > sum(diff(rep) < 0)) {
        print("----- 2 -----")
        out <- iscorrtrue(rep, reptrue1)
    } else if (sum(diff(rep) < 0) > sum(diff(rep) > 0)) {
        print("----- 3 -----")
        out <- iscorrtrue(rep, reptrue2)
    } else {
        out <- FALSE
    }
    if (out == FALSE) {
        print("----- 4 -----")
        rep <- na.omit(as.numeric(row))[-1]
        repdiff <- diff(rep)
        reptrue1 <- !(repdiff < 1 | repdiff > 3)
        reptrue2 <- !(repdiff < -3 | repdiff > -1)
        out <- isalltrue(reptrue1, reptrue2)
        print(c(rep))
        print(out)
    }
    return(out)
}
```
</div>
</details>

My actual working approach was in the end **brute force**. I just threw out each
element in a row and checked if the report became positive - much simpler and effective!

```jupyter-R
isreport2 <- function(row) {
    rep <- na.omit(row)
    out <- isalltrue(rep)
    if (out == FALSE) {
        for (i in seq_along(rep)) {
            # rep <- rep[-i] does not update the variable
            # with rep.i, a new variable is assigned (rep.1, rep.2, ...)
            rep.i <- rep[-i]
            out <- isalltrue(rep.i)
            if (out == TRUE) {
                break
            }
        }
    }
    return(out)
}
sum(apply(data, 1, isreport2))
```
