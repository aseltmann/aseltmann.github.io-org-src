This year I try to record my attempt at solving the **Advent of Code 2023**
riddles. This is Day 4 - see <https:adventofcode.com/2023/day/4>


## Part 1 {#part-1}

<details>
<summary>Lets first read the task:</summary>
<div class="details">

> The Elf leads you over to the pile of colorful cards. There, you discover dozens
> of scratchcards, all with their opaque covering already scratched off. Picking
> one up, it looks like each card has two lists of numbers separated by a vertical
> bar (`|`): a list of **winning numbers** and then a list of **numbers you have**.
> You organize the information into a table (your puzzle input).
>
> As far as the Elf has been able to figure out, you have to figure out which of
> the **numbers you have** appear in the list of **winning numbers**. The first match
> makes the card worth **one point** and each match after the first **doubles** the
> point value of that card.
>
> For example:

```text
Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53
Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19
Card 3:  1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14  1
Card 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58  5 54 83
Card 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36
Card 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11
```

> In the above example, card 1 has five winning numbers (`41`, `48`, `83`, `86`,
> and `17`) and eight numbers you have (`83`, `86`, `6`, `31`, `17`, `9`, `48`,
> and `53`). Of the numbers you have, four of them (`48`, `83`, `17`, and `86`)
> are winning numbers! That means card 1 is worth `8` points (1 for the first
> match, then doubled three times for each of the three matches after the first).
>
> -   Card 2 has two winning numbers (`32` and `61`), so it is worth `2` points.
> -   Card 3 has two winning numbers (`1` and `21`), so it is worth `2` points.
> -   Card 4 has one winning number (`84`), so it is worth `1` point.
> -   Card 5 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points.
> -   Card 6 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points.
>
> So, in this example, the Elf's pile of scratchcards is worth `13` points.
>
> Take a seat in the large pile of colorful cards. **How many points are they worth
> in total?**

My input file: [2023-12-04-1-aoc.txt](https://github.com/aseltmann/aseltmann.github.io-org-src/blob/main/data/2023-12-04-1-aoc.txt)

Loading this data is very similar to **Day 2** - so let's load the data as we did
there. Our goal is to get `win` and `yours` columns holding the respective
digits which we want to compare. We find the numbers with one or more digits
using the regex `\d+`. And we want them to be in **sets** (not lists), as we can
logically compare sets in Python.

```python
import pandas as pd
import re

txt = pd.read_table('data/2023-12-04-1-aoc.txt', names=['win'])
txt['id'] = txt.loc[:, 'win'].str.split(':').apply(
    lambda x: int(x[0].strip('Card ')))
txt['win'] = (txt.loc[:, 'win']
              .str.split(':').apply(lambda x: x[1]))
txt['yours'] = (txt.loc[:, 'win']
                .str.split('|')
                .apply(lambda x: x[1])
                # get a list of only the numbers / digits
                .apply(lambda x: re.findall(r'\d+', x))
                # convert the list of strings to a set of integers
                .apply(lambda x: set([int(i) for i in x])))
txt['win'] = (txt.loc[:, 'win']
              .str.split('|')
              .apply(lambda x: x[0])
              .apply(lambda x: re.findall(r'\d+', x))
              .apply(lambda x: set([int(i) for i in x])))

txt
```

218 rows × 3 columns

Now, we get the [logical conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction) of `win` and `yours`, these are our winning
numbers. Then, the number of wins is converted to points - for all number of
wins bigger than 1, we can get the points by `2**(n_wins-1)`.

```python
txt['n_wins'] = txt.apply(
    lambda row: len(row.loc['win'] & row.loc['yours']), axis=1)
txt['points'] = txt.loc[:, 'n_wins'].apply(
    lambda x: 2**(x-1) if x > 1 else x)

txt.loc[:, ['win', 'n_wins', 'points']]
```

|     | win                                      | n_wins | points |
|-----|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| 0   | {32, 36, 7, 9, 10, 12, 82, 85, 95, 31}   | 10     | 512    |
| 1   | {35, 76, 16, 82, 19, 22, 88, 59, 60, 95} | 10     | 512    |
| 2   | {1, 70, 11, 78, 48, 19, 52, 88, 28, 94}  | 5      | 16     |
| 3   | {65, 2, 72, 28, 14, 16, 55, 91, 92, 62}  | 0      | 0      |
| 4   | {38, 41, 75, 77, 50, 24, 94, 60, 61, 30} | 0      | 0      |
| ... | ...                                      | ...    | ...    |
| 213 | {97, 98, 39, 41, 43, 12, 13, 19, 93, 95} | 0      | 0      |
| 214 | {97, 35, 69, 40, 74, 45, 20, 21, 62, 31} | 0      | 0      |
| 215 | {33, 70, 71, 12, 78, 17, 51, 86, 60, 94} | 2      | 2      |
| 216 | {98, 67, 68, 38, 70, 39, 72, 77, 45, 21} | 1      | 1      |
| 217 | {34, 9, 44, 78, 79, 16, 17, 19, 55, 92}  | 0      | 0      |

218 rows × 3 columns

Then, we just sum up:

```python
sum(txt.loc[:, 'points'])
```

```text
25004
```

We will use the  `n_wins` column we created before and go from there. We step
through each Game. Each **current game** gets +1 card. Then, we step through the
number of **next games** depending on our `n_wins`. Each of these gets added the
card number of the **current game**.

```python
txt['cards'] = 0

for i, nwin in enumerate(txt.loc[:, 'n_wins']):
    txt.loc[i, 'cards'] += 1
    for j in range(1, nwin+1):
        txt.loc[i+j, 'cards'] += txt.loc[i, 'cards']

txt.loc[:, ['n_wins', 'cards']]
```

|     | n_wins | cards |
|-----|--------|-------|
| 0   | 10     | 1     |
| 1   | 10     | 2     |
| 2   | 5      | 4     |
| 3   | 0      | 8     |
| 4   | 0      | 8     |
| ... | ...    | ...   |
| 213 | 0      | 9608  |
| 214 | 0      | 8927  |
| 215 | 2      | 8927  |
| 216 | 1      | 12636 |
| 217 | 0      | 21564 |

218 rows × 2 columns

Now, we just sum the output again:

```python
sum(txt['cards'])
```

```text
14427616
```
