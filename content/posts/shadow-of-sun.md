General impression: thoughtful book, mostly he tries to avoid [single stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Ihs241zeg) and
gives an impression of different scenes in or between different African
countries from the end of the 1950s till the 1990s. From time to time he tries
to explain certain view or mentalities in African countries, which might come of
as condescending from todays view and be of more interest to non-African readers
than to African readers.
