This year I try to record my attempt at solving the **Advent of Code 2023**
riddles. This is Day 2 - see <https:adventofcode.com/2023/day/2>


## Part 1 {#part-1}

Lets first read the task:

> As you walk, the Elf shows you a small bag and some cubes which are either red,
> green, or blue. Each time you play this game, he will hide a secret number of
> cubes of each color in the bag, and your goal is to figure out information about
> the number of cubes.
>
> To get information, once a bag has been loaded with cubes, the Elf will reach
> into the bag, grab a handful of random cubes, show them to you, and then put
> them back in the bag. He'll do this a few times per game.
>
> You play several games and record the information from each game (your puzzle
> input). Each game is listed with its ID number (like the `11` in `Game 11: ...`)
> followed by a semicolon-separated list of subsets of cubes that were revealed
> from the bag (like `3 red, 5 green, 4 blue`).
>
> For example, the record of a few games might look like this:

```text
Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green
```

> In game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put back
> again). The first set is 3 blue cubes and 4 red cubes; the second set is 1 red
> cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes; the third set is only 2 green cubes.
>
> The Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag
> contained **only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes**?
>
> In the example above, games 1, 2, and 5 would have been possible if the bag had
> been loaded with that configuration. However, game 3 would have been impossible
> because at one point the Elf showed you 20 red cubes at once; similarly, game 4
> would also have been impossible because the Elf showed you 15 blue cubes at
> once. If you add up the IDs of the games that would have been possible, you
> get `8`.
>
> Determine which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with
> only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes. **What is the sum of the IDs
> of those games**?

Okay, let's load our python kernel in emacs-jupyter and get coding! First of
all, let's load the input and split the riddle code by colon `:` to extract the
game id and the rest of the code by semicolon `;` to get the number of sets
played in each game.

```python
import pandas as pd
import re

txt = pd.read_table('data/2023-12-02-1-aoc.txt', names=['code'])
txt['id'] = txt.loc[:, 'code'].str.split(':').apply(
    lambda x: int(x[0].strip('Game ')))
txt['code'] = txt.loc[:, 'code'].str.split(':').apply(lambda x: x[1])
# txt['code'] = txt.loc[:, 'code'].str.split(';')
# txt['nsets'] = txt.loc[:, 'code'].apply(lambda x: len(x))
txt
```

```text
                                                 code   id
0    1 green, 1 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 8 red, 7 blu...    1
1    9 red, 7 green, 3 blue; 15 green, 2 blue, 5 r...    2
2    3 red, 1 blue, 4 green; 6 red, 3 green, 2 blu...    3
3    2 blue, 2 green, 19 red; 3 blue, 11 red, 16 g...    4
4    8 green, 1 red, 12 blue; 10 green, 6 red, 13 ...    5
..                                                ...  ...
95    2 red, 2 green, 1 blue; 1 red, 4 green; 1 green   96
96   4 red, 5 green; 5 blue, 3 red; 8 blue, 2 gree...   97
97   1 blue; 2 green, 1 red; 5 red, 2 green; 4 red...   98
98   6 blue, 5 red, 2 green; 9 red, 1 blue; 2 gree...   99
99   1 blue, 13 green, 14 red; 11 green, 11 blue, ...  100

[100 rows x 2 columns]
```

Now, let's extract the three colors in different columns with regex. We use the
lookahead assertion `?=` to find the respective colours and only exctract the
digits `\d+` coming before. Then we just keep the `max` imum drawn number of cubes
per color, since this is the only information that matters at the moment.

```python
txt['green'] = txt.loc[:, 'code'].apply(
    lambda code: re.findall(r'\d+(?=.green)', code)).apply(
        lambda list: max([int(i) for i in list]))
txt['red'] = txt.loc[:, 'code'].apply(
    lambda code: re.findall(r'\d+(?=.red)', code)).apply(
        lambda list: max([int(i) for i in list]))
txt['blue'] = txt.loc[:, 'code'].apply(
    lambda code: re.findall(r'\d+(?=.blue)', code)).apply(
        lambda list: max([int(i) for i in list]))
txt
```

```text
                                                 code   id  green  red  blue
0    1 green, 1 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 8 red, 7 blu...    1      2   10    10
1    9 red, 7 green, 3 blue; 15 green, 2 blue, 5 r...    2     15   10     3
2    3 red, 1 blue, 4 green; 6 red, 3 green, 2 blu...    3      4    6    16
3    2 blue, 2 green, 19 red; 3 blue, 11 red, 16 g...    4     16   20    18
4    8 green, 1 red, 12 blue; 10 green, 6 red, 13 ...    5     10    6    14
..                                                ...  ...    ...  ...   ...
95    2 red, 2 green, 1 blue; 1 red, 4 green; 1 green   96      4    2     1
96   4 red, 5 green; 5 blue, 3 red; 8 blue, 2 gree...   97      5    4     8
97   1 blue; 2 green, 1 red; 5 red, 2 green; 4 red...   98      2    5     2
98   6 blue, 5 red, 2 green; 9 red, 1 blue; 2 gree...   99      2    9    11
99   1 blue, 13 green, 14 red; 11 green, 11 blue, ...  100     13   15    11

[100 rows x 5 columns]
```

Lastly, we just filter the DataFrame to only include games where all drawn cubes
were below or equal the number of cubes in the game and sum the result!

```python
txt['id'][(txt['green'] < 14) & (txt['red'] < 13) & (txt['blue'] < 15)].sum()
```

```text
3035
```


## Part 2 {#part-2}

First, let's get the instruction from the second part:

> As you continue your walk, the Elf poses a second question: in each game you
> played, what is the fewest number of cubes of each color that could have been in
> the bag to make the game possible?
>
> Again consider the example games from earlier:

```text
Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green
```

> -   In game 1, the game could have been played with as few as 4 red, 2 green, and
>     6 blue cubes. If any color had even one fewer cube, the game would have been
>     impossible.
> -   Game 2 could have been played with a minimum of 1 red, 3 green, and 4 blue
>     cubes.
> -   Game 3 must have been played with at least 20 red, 13 green, and 6 blue cubes.
> -   Game 4 required at least 14 red, 3 green, and 15 blue cubes.
> -   Game 5 needed no fewer than 6 red, 3 green, and 2 blue cubes in the bag.
>
> The **power** of a set of cubes is equal to the numbers of red, green, and blue
> cubes multiplied together. The power of the minimum set of cubes in game 1
> is 48. In games 2-5 it was 12, 1560, 630, and 36, respectively. Adding up these
> five powers produces the sum 2286.
>
> For each game, find the minimum set of cubes that must have been present. **What
> is the sum of the power of these sets?**

Luckily, this task is made trivial by the approach we have taken before. We just
have to multiply the `green`, `red` and `blue` columns:

```python
txt['power'] = txt.loc[:, 'green'] * txt.loc[:, 'blue'] * txt.loc[:, 'red']
txt
```

```text
                                                 code   id  green  red  blue  \
0    1 green, 1 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 8 red, 7 blu...    1      2   10    10
1    9 red, 7 green, 3 blue; 15 green, 2 blue, 5 r...    2     15   10     3
2    3 red, 1 blue, 4 green; 6 red, 3 green, 2 blu...    3      4    6    16
3    2 blue, 2 green, 19 red; 3 blue, 11 red, 16 g...    4     16   20    18
4    8 green, 1 red, 12 blue; 10 green, 6 red, 13 ...    5     10    6    14
..                                                ...  ...    ...  ...   ...
95    2 red, 2 green, 1 blue; 1 red, 4 green; 1 green   96      4    2     1
96   4 red, 5 green; 5 blue, 3 red; 8 blue, 2 gree...   97      5    4     8
97   1 blue; 2 green, 1 red; 5 red, 2 green; 4 red...   98      2    5     2
98   6 blue, 5 red, 2 green; 9 red, 1 blue; 2 gree...   99      2    9    11
99   1 blue, 13 green, 14 red; 11 green, 11 blue, ...  100     13   15    11

    power
0     200
1     450
2     384
3    5760
4     840
..    ...
95      8
96    160
97     20
98    198
99   2145

[100 rows x 6 columns]
```

And for this one, the sum is:

```python
txt['power'].sum()
```

```text
66027
```
