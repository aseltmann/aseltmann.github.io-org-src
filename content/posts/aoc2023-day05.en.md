This year I try to record my attempt at solving the **Advent of Code 2023**
riddles. This is Day 5 - see <https:adventofcode.com/2023/day/5>

Update <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2023-12-31 So]</span></span>:

-   subsitute get_generator() (own implementation) with range() (Python inbuilt)
-   improve grid search so that it goes through all location ranges, still
    starting with the lowest range


## Part 1 {#part-1}

Lets first read the task:

> The almanac (your puzzle input) lists all of the seeds that need to be planted.
> It also lists what type of soil to use with each kind of seed, what type of
> fertilizer to use with each kind of soil, what type of water to use with each
> kind of fertilizer, and so on. Every type of seed, soil, fertilizer and so on is
> identified with a number, but numbers are reused by each category - that is,
> soil `123` and fertilizer `123` aren't necessarily related to each other.
>
> For example:

```text
seeds: 79 14 55 13

seed-to-soil map:
50 98 2
52 50 48

soil-to-fertilizer map:
0 15 37
37 52 2
39 0 15

fertilizer-to-water map:
49 53 8
0 11 42
42 0 7
57 7 4

water-to-light map:
88 18 7
18 25 70

light-to-temperature map:
45 77 23
81 45 19
68 64 13

temperature-to-humidity map:
0 69 1
1 0 69

humidity-to-location map:
60 56 37
56 93 4
```

> The almanac starts by listing which seeds need to be planted: seeds `79`, `14`,
> `55`, and `13`.
>
> The rest of the almanac contains a list of **maps** which describe how to convert

> use with which fertilizer, and so on.
>
> Rather than list every source number and its corresponding destination number
> one by one, the maps describe entire **ranges** of numbers that can be converted.
> Each line within a map contains three numbers: the **destination range start**,
> the **source range start**, and the **range length**.
>
> Consider again the example `seed-to-soil map`:
>
> `50 98 2
> 52 50 48`
>
> The first line has a **destination range start** of `50`, a **source range start**

> the same length, but it starts at `50`, so its two values are `50` and `51`.
> With this information, you know that seed number `98` corresponds to soil number
> `50` and that seed number `99` corresponds to soil number `51`.
> o
> The second line means that the source range starts at `50` and contains `48`
> values: `50`, `51`, ..., `96`, `97`. This corresponds to a destination range
> starting at `52` and also containing `48` values: `52`, `53`, ..., `98`, `99`.
> So, seed number `53` corresponds to soil number `55`.
>
> Any source numbers that **aren't mapped** correspond to the **same** destination
> number. So, seed number `10` corresponds to soil number `10`.
>
> So, the entire list of seed numbers and their corresponding soil numbers looks

```text
seed  soil
0     0
1     1

51    53
...   ...
96    98
97    99

```

Wow, this task is a mouthful...

Let's start slowly and load the data. Our input text document contains several
maps, which are clearly separated and have a title (`seed-to-soil map` etc). So
we can tell pandas where each map starts and give each map a dataframe. I got
the values for the `skiprows` and `nrows` argument by looking at the input file
and... counting
:)

```python
import pandas as pd
import sys

seeds = pd.read_table('data/2023-12-05-1-aoc.txt', nrows=1, sep=' ',
                      header=None, index_col=0)
seeds = seeds.values.flatten()

map_opt = {'filepath_or_buffer': 'data/2023-12-05-1-aoc.txt',
           'header': None, 'sep': ' ', 'dtype': 'Int64',
           'names': ['dest_start', 'src_start', 'range']}

seed_soil = pd.read_table(skiprows=3, nrows=23, **map_opt)
soil_fert = pd.read_table(skiprows=28, nrows=9, **map_opt)
fert_water = pd.read_table(skiprows=39, nrows=20, **map_opt)
water_light = pd.read_table(skiprows=61, nrows=40, **map_opt)
light_temp = pd.read_table(skiprows=103, nrows=36, **map_opt)
temp_humi = pd.read_table(skiprows=141, nrows=35, **map_opt)
humi_loc = pd.read_table(skiprows=178, nrows=26, **map_opt)

maps = (seed_soil, soil_fert, fert_water, water_light, light_temp,
        temp_humi, humi_loc)

print('seeds are just a numpy array:')
display(seeds)
print('The "humidity-to-location" map as an example:')
humi_loc
```

```text
seeds are just a numpy array:
array([3169137700,  271717609, 3522125441,   23376095, 1233948799,
        811833837,  280549587,  703867355,  166086528,   44766996,

The "humidity-to-location" map as an example:
```

My first attempt was to actually construct ranges like in the example above,
mapping out all possible sources and destinations. Python quickly informed me
that even constructing one `pandas.Series` with `int64` values mapping seeds to
soil would cost 64GB memory - not the best solution.

So we take a different approach. For convenience, let's add a `src_end` and a
`dest_end` column to our maps:

```python
for df in maps:
    df['src_end'] = df.loc[:, 'src_start'] + df.loc[:, 'range']
    df['dest_end'] = df.loc[:, 'dest_start'] + df.loc[:, 'range']

print('Again the "humidity-to-location" map as an example:')
humi_loc
```

```text
Again the "humidity-to-location" map as an example:
```

Now we actually compute the mapping. For each seed, we go through all mappings
and in each mapping we go through each row. We find the row which contains the
mapping and exctract the destination, which is the source for the next map until
we reach the last map which gives us the locations.

-   Approach 1: `df.itertuples()` is a convenient way to step through a
    `pandas.DataFrame` in this example. It is faster than `df.iterrows()` and
    returns the row as a `NamedTuple` -  nice!

-   Approach 2: I actually wondered if it would be faster to get all maps in one
    `pd.DataFrame` and then iterate through the mappings. To test this let's
    construct a new DataFrame `maps_df` which contains all `maps`. Since the maps
    have different lengths it is important to cast the datatype to `Int64`, which
    is short for `pd.Int64Dtype()` and keeps values as integers, even if `NA`
    values are in the same column.

-   Approach 3: A third alternative I tested (not shown here) was to check if a
    value is in a Python `range` with the `in` operator as in: `if 3 in
        range(5):...` . This was way too slow.

> Consider all of the initial seed numbers listed in the ranges on the first line

Let's first construct a dataframe containing the range of seeds:

```python
seeds_df = pd.DataFrame({'start': seeds[::2],
                         'range': seeds[1::2],
                         'end': seeds[::2] + seeds[1::2]})
print(f'There are {sum(seeds_df.loc[:, "range"]):_} seeds in total')
seeds_df
```

```text
There are 2_549_759_327 seeds in total
```

Now - I really needed some time to finally realize, that going through all seed
values is really unfeasable. So how do we deal with this problem?

In the end we need the lowest location number - thus our approach is to take
the `humi_loc` map, start with the lowest location number and go up and get the
corresponding seed values. The location of the first seed value which is inside
`seeds_df` is our solution.

So first we rebuild the `get_location` function to a `get_seed` function (we
reverse the `maps` tuple with `maps[::-1]` and switch `src` and `dest`).

```python
def get_seed(location):
    current = location
    for df in maps[::-1]:
        current_map = [row
                       for row in df.itertuples()
                       if ((current >= row.dest_start)
                           and (current < row.dest_end))]
        if len(current_map) == 0:
            pass
        elif len(current_map) == 1:
            current = (current_map[0].src_start
                       + (current - current_map[0].dest_start))
        else:
            raise ValueError('This should not happen!')
    return current
```

Since the Python 3 `range` function does not store it's contents in memory
(similar to a generator), it is well suited to go through these large ranges.

Lastly, we deal with the sheer amount of possible values by performing a **grid
search**. First, we check every millionth location. After the first match, we
stop this search and check the last million locations before the match with a
finer grid and so on. The last grid is just `1`, so we find our lowest location.

Update: We order our locations from smallest to largest with `sort_values` and
go through them - but the search stops after the first match, since that will be
our lowest location.

```python
def grid_search(start: int, end: int, grid: list[int]):
    success = False
    for g in grid:
        print(f'Start search with grid={g}')
        for l in range(start, end, g):
            current = get_seed(l)
            if any((current >= seeds_df.loc[:, 'start']) & (current < seeds_df.loc[:, 'end'])):
                print(f'location {l} is the lowest which contains one of the given seeds ({current})')
                start = l - g
                end = l
                success = True
                break
    return success

for row in humi_loc.sort_values('dest_start').itertuples():
    success = grid_search(start=row.dest_start, end=row.dest_end,
                          grid=[1_000_000, 100_000, 1000, 1])
    if success:
        print('Finished search')
        break
```

```text
Start search with grid=1000000
location 85000000 is the lowest which contains one of the given seeds (2605777210)
