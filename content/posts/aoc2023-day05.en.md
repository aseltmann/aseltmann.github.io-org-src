This year I try to record my attempt at solving the **Advent of Code 2023**
riddles. This is Day 5 - see <https:adventofcode.com/2023/day/5>


## Part 1 {#part-1}

Lets first read the task:

> The almanac (your puzzle input) lists all of the seeds that need to be planted.
> It also lists what type of soil to use with each kind of seed, what type of
> fertilizer to use with each kind of soil, what type of water to use with each
> kind of fertilizer, and so on. Every type of seed, soil, fertilizer and so on is
> identified with a number, but numbers are reused by each category - that is,
> soil `123` and fertilizer `123` aren't necessarily related to each other.
>
> For example:

```text
seeds: 79 14 55 13

seed-to-soil map:
50 98 2
52 50 48

soil-to-fertilizer map:
0 15 37
37 52 2
39 0 15

fertilizer-to-water map:
49 53 8
0 11 42
42 0 7
57 7 4

water-to-light map:
88 18 7
18 25 70

light-to-temperature map:
45 77 23
81 45 19
68 64 13

temperature-to-humidity map:
0 69 1
1 0 69

humidity-to-location map:
60 56 37
56 93 4
```

> The almanac starts by listing which seeds need to be planted: seeds `79`, `14`,
> `55`, and `13`.
>
> The rest of the almanac contains a list of **maps** which describe how to convert
> numbers from a **source category** into numbers in a **destination category**. That
> is, the section that starts with `seed-to-soil map`: describes how to convert a
> **seed number** (the source) to a **soil number** (the destination). This lets the
> gardener and his team know which soil to use with which seeds, which water to
> use with which fertilizer, and so on.
>
> Rather than list every source number and its corresponding destination number
> one by one, the maps describe entire **ranges** of numbers that can be converted.
> Each line within a map contains three numbers: the **destination range start**,
> the **source range start**, and the **range length**.
>
> Consider again the example `seed-to-soil map`:
>
> `50 98 2
> 52 50 48`
>
> The first line has a **destination range start** of `50`, a **source range start**
> of `98`, and a **range length** of `2`. This line means that the source range
> starts at `98` and contains two values: `98` and `99`. The destination range is
> the same length, but it starts at `50`, so its two values are `50` and `51`.
> With this information, you know that seed number `98` corresponds to soil number
> `50` and that seed number `99` corresponds to soil number `51`.
> o
> The second line means that the source range starts at `50` and contains `48`
> values: `50`, `51`, ..., `96`, `97`. This corresponds to a destination range
> starting at `52` and also containing `48` values: `52`, `53`, ..., `98`, `99`.
> So, seed number `53` corresponds to soil number `55`.
>
> Any source numbers that **aren't mapped** correspond to the **same** destination
> number. So, seed number `10` corresponds to soil number `10`.
>
> So, the entire list of seed numbers and their corresponding soil numbers looks
> like this:

```text
seed  soil
0     0
1     1
...   ...
48    48
49    49
50    52
51    53
...   ...
96    98
97    99
98    50
99    51
```

> With this map, you can look up the soil number required for each initial seed
> number:
>
> -   Seed number `79` corresponds to soil number `81`.
> -   Seed number `14` corresponds to soil number `14`.
> -   Seed number `55` corresponds to soil number `57`.
> -   Seed number `13` corresponds to soil number `13`.
>
> The gardener and his team want to get started as soon as possible, so they'd

Wow, this task is a mouthful...

Let's start slowly and load the data. Our input text document contains several
maps, which are clearly separated and have a title (`seed-to-soil map` etc). So
we can tell pandas where each map starts and give each map a dataframe. I got
the values for the `skiprows` and `nrows` argument by looking at the input file
and... counting
:)

```python
  import pandas as pd
  import sys

  seeds = pd.read_table('data/2023-12-05-1-aoc.txt', nrows=1, sep=' ',
                        header=None, index_col=0)
  seeds = seeds.values.flatten()

  map_opt = {'filepath_or_buffer': 'data/2023-12-05-1-aoc.txt',
             'header': None, 'sep': ' ', 'dtype': 'Int64'}

  seed_soil = pd.read_table(skiprows=3, nrows=23, **map_opt,
                            names=['dest_start', 'src_start', 'range'])

  soil_fert = pd.read_table(skiprows=28, nrows=9, **map_opt,
                            names=['dest_start', 'src_start', 'range'])

  fert_water = pd.read_table(skiprows=39, nrows=20, **map_opt,
                             names=['dest_start', 'src_start', 'range'])

  water_light = pd.read_table(skiprows=61, nrows=40, **map_opt,
                              names=['dest_start', 'src_start', 'range'])

  light_temp = pd.read_table(skiprows=103, nrows=36, **map_opt,
                             names=['dest_start', 'src_start', 'range'])

  temp_humi = pd.read_table(skiprows=141, nrows=35, **map_opt,
                            names=['dest_start', 'src_start', 'range'])

  humi_loc = pd.read_table(skiprows=178, nrows=26, **map_opt,
                           names=['dest_start', 'src_start', 'range'])

  maps = (seed_soil, soil_fert, fert_water, water_light, light_temp,
          temp_humi, humi_loc)

  print('seeds are just a numpy array:')
  display(seeds)
  print('The "humidity-to-location" map as an example:')
  humi_loc
```

```text

My first attempt was to actually construct ranges like in the example above,
mapping out all possible sources and destinations. Python quickly informed my
that even constructing one `pandas.Series` with `int64` values mapping seeds to
soil would cost 64GB memory - not the best solution.

So we take a different approach. For convenience, let's add a `src_end` and a
`dest_end` column to our maps:

```python
  for df in maps:
      df['src_end'] = df.loc[:, 'src_start'] + df.loc[:, 'range']
      df['dest_end'] = df.loc[:, 'dest_start'] + df.loc[:, 'range']

  print('Again the "humidity-to-location" map as an example:')
  humi_loc
```

```text

Now, we actually compute the mapping. For each seed, we go through all mappings,
and in each mapping through each row. We find the row which contains the mapping
and exctract the destination, which is the source for the next map until we
reach the last map which gives us the locations.

-   Approach 1: `df.itertuples()` is a convenient way to step through a
    `pandas.DataFrame` in this example. It is faster than `df.iterrows()` and
    returns the row as a `NamedTuple` -  nice!

-   Approach 2: I actually wondered if it would be faster to get all maps in one
    `pd.DataFrame` and then iterate through the mappings. For that, let's
    construct a new DataFrame `maps_df`, which contains all `maps`. Since the maps
    have different lengths it is important to cast the datatype to `Int64`, which
    is short for `pd.Int64Dtype()` and keeps values as integers, even if `NA`
    values are in the same column.

-   Approach 3: A third alternative I tested (not shown here) was to check if a
    value is in a Python `range` with the `in` operator as in: `if 3 in
        range(5):...` . This was way too slow.

Lastly, just get the minimum of all location values.

Let's first construct a dataframe containing the range of seeds:

```python
  seeds_df = pd.DataFrame({'start': seeds[::2],
                           'range': seeds[1::2],
                           'end': seeds[::2] + seeds[1::2]})
  print(f'There are {sum(seeds_df.loc[:, "range"]):_} seeds in total')
  seeds_df
```

```text
There are 2_549_759_327 seeds in total
```

|   | start      | range     | end        |
|---|------------|-----------|------------|
| 0 | 3169137700 | 271717609 | 3440855309 |
| 1 | 3522125441 | 23376095  | 3545501536 |
| 2 | 1233948799 | 811833837 | 2045782636 |
| 3 | 280549587  | 703867355 | 984416942  |
| 4 | 166086528  | 44766996  | 210853524  |
| 5 | 2326968141 | 69162222  | 2396130363 |
| 6 | 2698492851 | 14603069  | 2713095920 |
| 7 | 2755327667 | 348999531 | 3104327198 |
| 8 | 2600461189 | 92332846  | 2692794035 |
| 9 | 1054656969 | 169099767 | 1223756736 |

Now - I really needed some time to finally realize, that going through all seed
values is really unfeasable. So how do we deal with this problem?

In the end, we need the lowest location number - thus our approach is to take
the `humi_loc` map (where `dest_start \== 0`), start with the lowest location
number and go up and get the corresponding seed values. The location of the
first seed value which is inside `seeds_df` is our solution.

So first we rebuild the `get_location` function to a `get_seed` function (we
reverse the `maps` tuple with `maps[::-1]` and switch `src` and `dest`).

```python
  def get_seed(location):
      current = location
      for df in maps[::-1]:
          current_map = [row
                         for row in df.itertuples()
                         if ((current >= row.dest_start)
                             and (current < row.dest_end))]
          if len(current_map) == 0:
              pass
          elif len(current_map) == 1:
              current = (current_map[0].src_start
                         + (current - current_map[0].dest_start))
          else:
              raise ValueError('This should not happen!')
      return current
```

To go through the possible locations efficiently, I decided to use a Python
**generator function** to go through the locations - this function does not store
the full list of `105_449_249` possible locations in the first batch
(`humi_loc.loc[9, 'dest_start']`) in memory - nice for our big numbers.

Lastly, we deal with the sheer amount of possible values by performing a **grid
search**. First, we check every millionth location. After the first match, we
stop this search and check the last million locations before the match with a
finer grid and so on. The last grid is just `1`, so we find our lowest location.

```python
  def get_generator(start, end, step=1):
      next = start
      while next < end:
          yield next
          next += step

  def grid_search(start: int, end: int, grid: list[int]):
      for g in grid:
          print(f'Start search with grid={g}')
          loc_gen = get_generator(start, end, g)
          for l in loc_gen:
              current = get_seed(l)
              if any((current >= seeds_df.loc[:, 'start']) & (current < seeds_df.loc[:, 'end'])):
                  print(f'location {l} is the lowest which contains one of the given seeds ({current})')
                  start = l - g
                  end = l
                  break
      print('Finished search')

  grid_search(start=humi_loc.loc[9, 'dest_start'],
              end=humi_loc.loc[9, 'dest_end'],
              grid=[1_000_000, 100_000, 1000, 1])
```

```text
Start search with grid=1000000
location 85000000 is the lowest which contains one of the given seeds (2605777210)
