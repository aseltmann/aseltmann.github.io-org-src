In a current project, we apply Deep Learning techniques on Fluorescence
Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) data to correct a variety of hardware- and
sample-related artifacts, such as photobleaching, contamination from additional
slow moving particles, or sudden drops in intensity because of detector
anomalies.
