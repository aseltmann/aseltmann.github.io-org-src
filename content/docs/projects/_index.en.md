## Current projects {#current-projects}

I am a believer in the principles of Open Science, Open Data and Open
Source. Thus, I am currently working on a reproducible way of conducting my
research on simulation of Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS)
measurements and correcting artifacts using neural networks, such as
Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs). I do not have my workflow fixed yet, but
to have an insight in my current approach - and with the principles of
[Open-notebook science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science) in mind:

<a href="https://aseltmann.github.io/fluotracify/">Fluotracify - doctoral research project done in a reproducible way</a>

Description: In a current project, we apply Deep Learning techniques on Fluorescence
Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) data to correct a variety of hardware- and
sample-related artifacts, such as photobleaching, contamination from additional
slow moving particles, or sudden drops in intensity because of detector
anomalies.
