## Phases after WWII {#phases-after-wwii}


### 1st phase: 50s/60s - rapid decolonization, optimism, euphoria {#1st-phase-50s-60s-rapid-decolonization-optimism-euphoria}

-   promise and hope, with freedom comes prosperity
-   movement of French colonies &rarr; want to become French citizens
-   movement of British colonies &rarr; **Pan-Africanism**
    -   people: activist [Alexander Crummell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Crummell), writer [W. E. B. Du Bois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois) (core idea:
        Black\* people should remain in the countries where they now live), journalist
        [Marcus Garvey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Garvey) (core idea: Black\* people should return to Africa)
    -   core ideas
        1.  all Blacks\* in the world constitute a single race, a single culture, and
            should be proud of their colour of skin
        2.  all of Africa should be independent and united &rarr; "Africa for Africans"
-   BUT: corrupt elites - why?
    -   no well-developed private sector, plantations belonged to foreigners, banks
        belong to foreign capital &rarr; political career was only way to richness


### 2nd phase: 70s/80s - rapid growth of population, pessimism {#2nd-phase-70s-80s-rapid-growth-of-population-pessimism}

-   civil wars, revolts, massacres, hunger
    -   opponents used all means (tribal and ethnic conflicts, military might,
        corruption, murder)
    -   cold war era → problems + interests of weaker, dependent countries were
        ignored, subordinate to superpower interests
-   coup d'etat in _Nigeria_ - military seizes power after only 5 years of
    independence
    -   and people celebrate! Since own elite is seen as too corrupt ("black
        imperialists", "political wolves, who plunder the country")
